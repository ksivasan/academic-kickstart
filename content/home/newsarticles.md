Watch this space for interesting articles I came across or referred recently. This is going to be massive list of logs soon.

- Learn how to find gradient of determinant from this [note](https://folk.ntnu.no/hanche/notes/diffdet/diffdet.pdf) by Harald Hanche-Olsen
- Trouble finding the probability density of linear transformation of Random variables? What if it is a matrix of transformation for a vector of random variables? Check out [this](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Random_Variables_and_Probability_Density_Functions)
- Robust machine learning is becoming of more interest as we see more of the ML algorithms becoming part of our lives - say resume screening systems in job applications, loan approving ML systems using credit data, news feed recommendations etc. For humans to explain the behaviour of such critical systems, robustness is an important criteria of ML algorithms. One of the pioneering researchers in this field [Dr.Thomas G. Dietterich](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/) recently tweeted his short course on [Trustable Machine learning] (http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/classes/qinghua-2018/index.html). It is an interesting read and starting point of lot to come!
